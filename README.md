Overview:
This project, developed in a Jupyter Notebook, involves scraping data from a Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue. The goal was to extract relevant data, organize it into a structured format, and save it as a CSV file for further analysis or use. This project demonstrates how to use web scraping techniques within an interactive environment to collect and process data.

Objective:
To extract and organize data about the largest U.S. companies by revenue from a Wikipedia page and store it in a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

Problem Statement:
The challenge was to automate the extraction of structured data from a Wikipedia page, which is formatted as an HTML table, and convert it into a clean, usable dataset for further processing.

Outcomes:
Successfully extracted data from the Wikipedia page, creating a CSV file containing information on the largest companies in the U.S. by revenue. The dataset includes company rank, name, industry, revenue, growth, number of employees, and headquarters location.

Impact:
This project demonstrates the ability to automate the extraction of structured data from a webpage, which can be applied in various fields for data collection, research, and analysis.


Lessons Learned:
Gained a deeper understanding of how to navigate and parse HTML structures using BeautifulSoup.
Improved skills in data extraction and cleaning, which are essential for preparing data for analysis.
Enhanced familiarity with Jupyter Notebook as a tool for data science projects, benefiting from its interactive environment.
